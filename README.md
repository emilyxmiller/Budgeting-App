# Budgeting-App
This is a RESTful budgeting application using Python 3, Flask, Jinja2 Templating engine, 
Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-RESTful, AJAJ, and vanilla JavaScript. 

The user can sign up and keep track of monthly budget categories and purchases in 
each of those categories. It performs budget analysis using functional programming to 
let the user know how much money they have left in each category or if they overspent. 

It is sensitive to spaces after information entered in the forms so make sure you are 
aware of that if you try to run it! It will throw an error if you have a space after inputs.
